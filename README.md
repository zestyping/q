q
=

Quick and dirty debugging output for tired programmers.

Install q with "easy\_install -U q" or "pip install -U q".

All output goes to /tmp/q, which you can watch with this shell command:

    tail -f /tmp/q

To print the value of foo, insert this into your program:

    import q; q(foo)

Use "q/" to print the value of something in the middle of an expression
while leaving the result unaffected.  In this example, you can print the
value of f(y) without needing to put f(y) in a temporary variable:

    x = q/f(y) + z

To trace a function's arguments and return value, insert this above the def:

    import q
    @q

To start an interactive shell at any point in your code, call q.d():

    import q; q.d()
